# WORKFLOW PARAMETERS #
#######################

# Currently, only "gene" has been tested for this workflow. Setting this to
# "exon" will treat each exon as a locus from the GFF3 file and likely will
# not work if using multiple GFF3+FASTAs in the ea_input specified above. 
gene_or_exon: "gene"
# Set to "l", "ae", or "cds". Must correspond to the previous parameter. Use 
# "ae"/"cds" to extract exons or CDS sequences when assembling exons. Else, 
# use "l" to extract the assembled locus when assembling whole genes.  
groupby: "l"
# Whether to filter when assigning recruited reads. If "yes", then only those
# reads which mapped to a single location will be included in each FASTQ set 
# for each individual locus' assembly. Default "no" since most of the time
# the input set has redundant loci due to including multiple alleles of the 
# same locus.
filter: "no"
# second_paired_suffixes should be set to "yes" if your WGS read IDs end with 
# .1 and .2 for each respective pair. If they don't, then leave as a "no". Note
# that GSNAP by default will trim this in the resulting SAM file while SMALT 
# will not. 
second_paired_suffixes: "no"
# When reporting the %IDs and the coverage for the alignments between the new
# assembled sequence and the reference, either report only the best one or all.
best_only: "no"
# How much of a pad to give the sequences when recruiting in GSNAP/SMALT. 
# Should give a bit of a pad if data in reads1/reads2 are longer than 151bp. 
# This will allow more read recruitment for smaller features. Can also add 
# padding if trying to build very short sequences so that these can better
# recruit reads in the alignment step.
buffer: 0
# How many partitions to randomly assign reads to when using HGA. Due to the
# rather small dataset of FASTQ sequences often built for a locus, this value
# should stay low. Read more on Hierarchical Genome Assembly before changing
# this value. 
partitions: 2
# Comma separated list of odd, ascending numbers lesser than 128 to be used for 
# SPAdes and HGA tool as a backup. This list is used when the default kmers list
# generated by SPAdes does not create a valid kmer histogram. For lower coverage data,
# this list should use smaller values.
kmer: 7,11,21
# Cutoff when assessing the recruitment SAM file for whether or not to treat
# a read as recruited. Should be considered in conjunction with value set for
# "buffer". The lower this is set, the longer assembly will take as more reads
# will be considered recruited. Setting it very high may eliminate the 
# possibility to assemble sequences that are proportionally that much smaller
# than the read length. Max 100.
recruitment_threshold: 50
# The ratio for how long an assembled sequence must be compared to the reference
# in order to even attempt alignment. Max 1.0
min_align_len: 0.5
# Cutoff for considering a sequence to be assembled or not. Max 100. 
aligner_threshold: 90

# HARDWARE CONFIG #
###################

# How many jobs to spawn for individual assemblies. 
# BE CAREFUL with this as this value multiplied by the value specified for 
# threads_per_job should be LESS THAN the number of CPUs available. Similarly,
# the same holds true for this and the memory_per_job parameter.
number_of_jobs: 2
# How many threads to allot for each individual assembly job (how many jobs
# depends on value set for number_of_jobs). 
threads_per_job: 6
# How much memory, in GB, to allot for each individual assembly job (how many 
# jobs depends on value set for number_of_jobs). )
memory_per_job: 13
# How many threads to call when using GSNAP/SMALT. This value is independent of 
# any other parameters so it's probably best to set this to n-1 where n is the 
# number CPUs on the system.  
aligner_threads: 20
